                <p>"I had new service wires put in my house from my Electrical panel to my weatherhead, which required the electrical company to shut down power from the street. Edgar and his team work together with FPL to get the job done professionally in a timely matter. My tenants were restored with power within a few hours. I would highly recommend accuracy electric."</p>
