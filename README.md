# Accuracy Electric
This is my first solo project website. This website is intended to be used by customers in need of electrical services in south Florida. 

The about page shows users that the company is licensed and ensured as well as has 20 years of experience under their belt. The services page lists the several electrical services the company provides. The reviews page contains a clickable image that redirects users to a google form where clients are able to leave reviews. The reviews on this page are static, but are indeed real reviews from clients who have had eletrical services done by Accuracy Electric. The contact page shows where the company is located and contains a form that can be filled out by clients. Upon completion of this form, information about the client and their respective services needed are sent to the company, allowing for quick work to be done. I was also able to create a Privacy Policy, where clients can be aware of the security of their information that is submitted in the form. 

This website is fully functional, however this website in not complete as I would like to upgrade it and add more features (images of services, new link for reviews...)
